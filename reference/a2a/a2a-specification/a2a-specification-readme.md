# Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)

This readme sourced from: https://github.com/google/A2A

**_An open protocol enabling communication and interoperability between opaque agentic applications._**

One of the biggest challenges in enterprise AI adoption is getting agents built on different frameworks and vendors to work together. That‚Äôs why we created an open _Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol_, a collaborative way to help agents across different ecosystems communicate with each other. Google is driving this open protocol initiative for the industry because we believe this protocol will be **critical to support multi-agent communication by giving your agents a common language ‚Äì irrespective of the framework or vendor they are built on**.
With _A2A_, agents can show each other their capabilities and negotiate how they will interact with users (via text, forms, or bidirectional audio/video) ‚Äì all while working securely together.

### Conceptual Overview

The Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol facilitates communication between independent AI agents. Here are the core concepts:

* **Agent Card:** A public metadata file (usually at `/.well-known/agent.json`) describing an agent's capabilities, skills, endpoint URL, and authentication requirements. Clients use this for discovery.
* **A2A Server:** An agent exposing an HTTP endpoint that implements the A2A protocol methods (defined in the [json specification](/specification)). It receives requests and manages task execution.
* **A2A Client:** An application or another agent that consumes A2A services. It sends requests (like `tasks/send`) to an A2A Server's URL.
* **Task:** The central unit of work. A client initiates a task by sending a message (`tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe`). Tasks have unique IDs and progress through states (`submitted`, `working`, `input-required`, `completed`, `failed`, `canceled`).
* **Message:** Represents communication turns between the client (`role: "user"`) and the agent (`role: "agent"`). Messages contain `Parts`.
* **Part:** The fundamental content unit within a `Message` or `Artifact`. Can be `TextPart`, `FilePart` (with inline bytes or a URI), or `DataPart` (for structured JSON, e.g., forms).
* **Artifact:** Represents outputs generated by the agent during a task (e.g., generated files, final structured data). Artifacts also contain `Parts`.
* **Streaming:** For long-running tasks, servers supporting the `streaming` capability can use `tasks/sendSubscribe`. The client receives Server-Sent Events (SSE) containing `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` or `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` messages, providing real-time progress.
* **Push Notifications:** Servers supporting `pushNotifications` can proactively send task updates to a client-provided webhook URL, configured via `tasks/pushNotification/set`.

**Typical Flow:**

1. **Discovery:** Client fetches the Agent Card from the server's well-known URL.
2. **Initiation:** Client sends a `tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe` request containing the initial user message and a unique Task ID.
3. **Processing:**
    * **(Streaming):** Server sends SSE events (status updates, artifacts) as the task progresses.
    * **(Non-Streaming):** Server processes the task synchronously and returns the final `Task` object in the response.
4. **Interaction (Optional):** If the task enters `input-required`, the client sends subsequent messages using the same Task ID via `tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe`.
5. **Completion:** The task eventually reaches a terminal state (`completed`, `failed`, `canceled`).
